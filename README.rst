EdgeGrid for Python
===================

This library implements an Authentication handler for `requests`_
that provides the `Akamai {OPEN} Edgegrid Authentication`_ scheme. For more information
visit the `Akamai {OPEN} Developer Community`_.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import requests
    >>> from akamai.edgegrid import EdgeGridAuth
    >>> from urlparse import urljoin
    >>> baseurl = 'https://akaa-WWWWWWWWWWWW.luna.akamaiapis.net/'
    >>> s = requests.Session()
    >>> s.auth = EdgeGridAuth(
        client_token='ccccccccccccccccc',
        client_secret='ssssssssssssssssss',
        access_token='aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'
    )

    >>> result = s.get(urljoin(baseurl, '/diagnostic-tools/v2/ghost-locations/available'))
    >>> result.status_code
    200
    >>> result.json()['locations'][0]['value']
    Oakbrook, IL, United States
    ...

Alternatively, your program can read the credentials from an .edgerc file.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import requests
    >>> from akamai.edgegrid import EdgeGridAuth, EdgeRc
    >>> from urlparse import urljoin

    >>> edgerc = EdgeRc('~/.edgerc')
    >>> section = 'default'
    >>> baseurl = 'https://%s' % edgerc.get(section, 'host')

    >>> s = requests.Session()
    >>> s.auth = EdgeGridAuth.from_edgerc(edgerc, section)

    >>> result = s.get(urljoin(baseurl, '/diagnostic-tools/v2/ghost-locations/available'))
    >>> result.status_code
    200
    >>> result.json()['locations'][0]['value']
    Oakbrook, IL, United States
    ...
