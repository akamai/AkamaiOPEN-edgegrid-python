# EdgeGrid for Python

This library implements an Authentication handler for [HTTP requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) using the [Akamai EdgeGrid Authentication](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/authenticate-with-edgegrid) scheme for Python.

## Install

To use the library, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

> __NOTE:__ Python 2 is no longer supported by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/). You won't be able to use the library with Python 2.

Then, install the `edgegrid-python` authentication handler from sources by running this command from the project root directory:

   ```
   pip install .
   ```

Alternatively, you can install it from PyPI (Python Package Index) by running:

```
pip install edgegrid-python
```

## Authentication

We provide authentication credentials through an API client. Requests to the API are signed with a timestamp and are executed immediately.

1. [Create authentication credentials](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/set-up-authentication-credentials).
   
2. Place your credentials in an EdgeGrid resource file, `.edgerc`, under a heading of `[default]` at your local home directory or the home directory of a web-server user.
   
   ```
    [default]
    client_secret = C113nt53KR3TN6N90yVuAgICxIRwsObLi0E67/N8eRN=
    host = akab-h05tnam3wl42son7nktnlnnx-kbob3i3v.luna.akamaiapis.net
    access_token = akab-acc35t0k3nodujqunph3w7hzp7-gtm6ij
    client_token = akab-c113ntt0k3n4qtari252bfxxbsl-yvsdj
    ```

3. Use your local `.edgerc` by providing the path to your resource file and credentials' section header.
   
   ```python
    import requests
    from akamai.edgegrid import EdgeGridAuth, EdgeRc

    edgerc = EdgeRc('~/.edgerc')
    section = 'default'
    baseurl = 'https://%s' % edgerc.get(section, 'host')

    session = requests.Session()
    session.auth = EdgeGridAuth.from_edgerc(edgerc, section)
   ```
   Or hard code them as variables.
   
   ```python
    import requests
    from akamai.edgegrid import EdgeGridAuth

    session = requests.Session()
    session.auth = EdgeGridAuth(
        client_token='akab-c113ntt0k3n4qtari252bfxxbsl-yvsdj',
        client_secret='C113nt53KR3TN6N90yVuAgICxIRwsObLi0E67/N8eRN=',
        access_token='akab-acc35t0k3nodujqunph3w7hzp7-gtm6ij'
    )
   ```

## Use

To use the library, provide the path to your `.edgerc`, your credentials section header, and the appropriate endpoint information.

```python
import requests
import json
from akamai.edgegrid import EdgeGridAuth, EdgeRc
from urllib.parse import urljoin

edgerc = EdgeRc('~/.edgerc')
section = 'default'
baseurl = 'https://%s' % edgerc.get(section, 'host')

session = requests.Session()
session.auth = EdgeGridAuth.from_edgerc(edgerc, section)

path = '/identity-management/v3/user-profile'
headers = {
  "Accept": "application/json"
} 
querystring = {
  "actions": True,
  "authGrants": True,
  "notifications": True
}  

result = session.get(urljoin(baseurl, path), headers=headers, params=querystring)
print(result.status_code)
print(json.dumps(result.json(), indent=2))
```

### Query string parameters

When entering query parameters use the `querystring` property. Set up the parameters as name-value pairs in an object.

```python
edgerc = EdgeRc('~/.edgerc')
section = 'default'
baseurl = 'https://%s' % edgerc.get(section, 'host')

session = requests.Session()
session.auth = EdgeGridAuth.from_edgerc(edgerc, section)

path = '/identity-management/v3/user-profile'
querystring = {
  "actions": True,
  "authGrants": True,
  "notifications": True
}  

result = session.get(urljoin(baseurl, path), params=querystring)
```

### Headers

Enter request headers in the `headers` property as name-value pairs in an object.

> __NOTE:__ You don't need to include the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers. The authentication layer adds these values.

```python
edgerc = EdgeRc('~/.edgerc')
section = 'default'
baseurl = 'https://%s' % edgerc.get(section, 'host')

session = requests.Session()
session.auth = EdgeGridAuth.from_edgerc(edgerc, section)

path = '/identity-management/v3/user-profile'
headers = {
  "Accept": "application/json"
} 

result = session.get(urljoin(baseurl, path), headers=headers)
```

### Body data

Provide the request body as an object in the `payload` property.

```python
edgerc = EdgeRc('~/.edgerc')
section = 'default'
baseurl = 'https://%s' % edgerc.get(section, 'host')

session = requests.Session()
session.auth = EdgeGridAuth.from_edgerc(edgerc, section)

path = '/identity-management/v3/user-profile/basic-info'
payload = {
    "contactType": "Billing",
    "country": "USA",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "preferredLanguage": "English",
    "sessionTimeOut": 30,
    "timeZone": "GMT",
    "phone": "3456788765"
}

result = session.put(urljoin(baseurl, path), json=payload)
```

As the `data` parameter for the `session` methods, EdgeGrid for Python
currently supports the `bytes` and `requests_toolbelt.MultipartEncoder`
types or a file-like object.

### Debug

Enable debugging to get additional information about a request.

To log requests, use the built-in request logging. Add this before making a request:

```python
import logging
from http.client import HTTPConnection
HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1
logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
urllib_log = logging.getLogger("urllib3")
urllib_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
urllib_log.propagate = True
```

This will print everything apart from the HTTP response body. See the [Requests library for Python](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#api-changes) for the original recipe.

To log specific parts like URL, status code, headers, or body, add this:

```python
import requests
import logging
import json
from akamai.edgegrid import EdgeGridAuth, EdgeRc
from urllib.parse import urljoin

logger = logging.getLogger('requests_logger')
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

edgerc = EdgeRc('~/.edgerc')
section = 'default'
baseurl = 'https://%s' % edgerc.get(section, 'host')

session = requests.Session()
session.auth = EdgeGridAuth.from_edgerc(edgerc, section)

path = '/identity-management/v3/user-profile'

result = session.get(urljoin(baseurl, path))
logger.debug(f'URL: {result.url}')
logger.debug(f'Status Code: {result.status_code}')
logger.debug(f'Headers: {result.headers}')
logger.debug(f'Body: {result.json()}')
```

## Virtual environment

A [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is a tool to keep dependencies required by different projects in separate places. The `venv` module is included in Python 3 by default.

Set up a virtual environment:

1. Initialize your environment in a new directory.

   ```
   // Unix/macOS
   python3 -m venv ~/Desktop/myenv

   // Windows
   py -m venv ~/Desktop/myenv
   ```

   This creates a `venv` in the specified directory as well as copies pip into it.

2. Activate your environment.
   
   ```
   // Unix/macOS
   source ~/Desktop/myenv/bin/activate

   // Windows
   ~/Desktop/myenv/Scripts/activate
   ```

   Your prompt will change to show you're working in a virtual environment, for example:

   ```
   (myenv) jsmith@abc-de12fg $
   ```

3. To recreate the environment, install the required dependencies within your project.

   ```
   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the tests.

   ```
   // Unix/macOS
   pytest -v

   // Windows
   py -m pytest -v
   ```

5. To deactivate your environment, run the `deactivate` command.
